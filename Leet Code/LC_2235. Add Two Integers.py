"""
Given two integers num1 and num2, return the sum of the two integers.
Example 1:
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: num1 is 12, num2 is 5, and their sum is 12 + 5 = 17, so 17 is returned.
"""
def sum(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2


num1 = -10
num2 = 5
res = sum(num1, num2)
print(res)
