In a given string you need to check if one symbol goes right after another. If so - return True, otherwise - False.
If one of the symbols is not in the given word - your function should return False. If two seeking symbols are the same - your function should return False.
Input: Three arguments. The first one is a given string, second is a symbol that should go first, and the third is a symbol that should go after the first one.
Output: A boolean."""
